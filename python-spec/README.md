# `somacore`: the Python version of the SOMA specification

`somacore` is a (currently in-development) Python interpretation of the
[abstract SOMA specification](../abstract_specification.md). Like the abstract
specification, it is still in flux and in progress, and we gladly accept
feedback. This will evolve in tandem with the abstract spec itself as well as
the [initial TileDB-based implementation](
  https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA).

For more information about our development process see [this project
plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e6L36SS-eazG6tHYwwnCfEfUcx_3dTFJUEE-gGxgFM4/edit).

        To add an existing collection as a sub-element of this collection,
        use :meth:`set` or indexed access instead.

        The type provided is used to create the skeleton of this collection
        as in :meth:`create`. By default, this will create a basic collection::

            # Create a child Measurement object at the key "density"
            # with default settings.
            #

        In situations where relative URIs are supported, the default URI of the
        child should be a sub-path of the parent URI. The final component
        should be a path-sanitized version of the new key. For instance, adding
        sub-element ``data`` to a Collection located at ``file:///path/to/coll``
        would have a default path of ``file:///path/to/coll/data``. For
        nonâ€“URI-safe keys, no specific path-sanitization method is required,

        ``file:///path/to/coll/non_path_safe`` as its full URI.

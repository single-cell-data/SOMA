  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
    # This mypy step is not perfect; in the interest of not reproducing
    # the entire dependency list here we only install `attrs`. It will catch
    # a useful subset of errors but does not replace a full mypy run
    # (either locally or in CI).
    rev: v1.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: mypy
        additional_dependencies: [attrs]

    rev: v2.7.1
    hooks:
      - id: prettier
        # For now we let this act on all files; if need be we can restrict it
        # with `types_or` in the future.

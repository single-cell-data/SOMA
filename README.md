# SOMA

SOMA, “stack of matrices, annotated,” is a flexible, extensible, and open-source API enabling access to data in a variety of formats. SOMA is designed to be general purpose for data that can be modeled as one or more sets of 2D annotated matrices that describe measurements of features across observations.

The driver use case of SOMA is single-cell data in the form of annotated matrices with observations — frequently cells — and features like genes, proteins, or genomic regions.


## Motivation

Datasets generated by profiling single cells are rapidly increasing in size and complexity. This has resulted in a need for scalable solutions to accommodate data sizes that no longer fit in memory and flexibility to accommodate the diversity of data being produced. 

To address these emerging needs in the single cell ecosystem, CZI, in partnership with the Feature and Observation Matrix (FOM) Schema Working Group and TileDB, is:

1. Driving the development of SOMA.
2. Providing its first implementation, [TileDB-SOMA](https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA) which utilizes the [TileDB Embedded](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB) engine.
3. Adopting TileDB-SOMA at [CZ CELLxGENE Discover](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) to build the [Cell Census](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB) which provides efficient access and querying of its data from > 40 million cells.

## Developer information

* [SOMA Abstract specification](./abstract_specification.md) — API specification agnostic to programming language.
* [Python SOMA interpretation](https://github.com/single-cell-data/SOMA/tree/main/python-spec) — a.k.a `somacore` it is the python version of the SOMA API.
